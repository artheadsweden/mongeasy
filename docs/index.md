# Mongeasy
[![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/mongeasy/month)](https://pepy.tech/project/mongeasy)

Mongeasy is a easy to use library to be used for simple access to a MongoDB database, without any need for schemas or validation. Just store the data as it is used in your application.

### Philosophy
The main philosophy of Mongeasy is that database access is just something that should work and not be a hassle. You should be able to focus on the business logic of your application and not have to worry about database access.

At the same time, you should be able to use the full power of MongoDB if you need to. This is why Mongeasy is built on top of the pymongo library. You can use the raw pymongo API if you need to, but for 'everyday' use you can use the Mongeasy API.
